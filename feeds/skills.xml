&lt;h1&gt;Play&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that playing board- and card-games has got numerous benefits. Plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/benefits-of-playing-board-games/"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; have been written about it so I will refrain from re-iterating. Part from all the mentioned benefits, for me probably the biggest one is that it is fun üòÑ. So it‚Äôs no secret I‚Äôm always up for a game of any sort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Set&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A card game I particularly like is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;. Simple in concept, yet very gripping. Simplest explanation is to find three cards that are completely similar or opposite in shape, filling, colour or number (follow the link for full rules).The player that sees the similarities / opposites first gets the cards. Most cards wins.I believe that particularly this is a game that sits close to my profession as software tester, in which looking for patterns, similarities, opposites is a key part of your job.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, even on a lazy Sunday while playing games, I‚Äôm learning to hone my professional skills‚Ä¶Have fun!  &lt;/p&gt;

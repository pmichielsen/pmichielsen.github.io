&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm not the best coder in the world… Let’s face it, I'm not even the best coder in my team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (making a liberal interpretation of &lt;a href="https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/beatles/did-john-lennon-say-ringo-wasnt-even-best-drummer/"&gt;the Ringo Starr joke&lt;/a&gt;). 
I'm well aware of that, and am absolutely fine with it. Just putting this &lt;em&gt;confession&lt;/em&gt; out here to set the scene for this article.&lt;br&gt;
For almost 25 years now I've been working with (test) automation, and during that time &lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/bloggers-club-february-2021-your-struggles-successes-with-automation/46900"&gt;I've had many struggles and successes with it&lt;/a&gt;. Let me reflect on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What "automation" means to me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me automation is so much more than using a tool for automated test case execution; I'm probably not the only one in the software testing profession with a similar view.&lt;br&gt;
Anything you can let a computer do to help you with your work I consider that as automation. For example in my first job at a bank, I wrote MS Excel formulas and macros to crunch- and process data; that's automation for me.
Using keyboard shortcuts for commonly used tasks (launching apps, advanced copy / paste, ...), &lt;a href="http://peetronics.com/WhatIHaveLearnedToday-005.html"&gt;enhanced custom searches in the browser bar&lt;/a&gt;; that's automation for me.
Using scripts to do various things (creating bug reports, produce verification reports, download YouTube clips and save as MP3); you guessed it, that's automation for me.&lt;br&gt;
Talking about automation here is in the broadest sense of the word.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said, I don't consider myself a good coder, even though I've been doing it for over 35 years now (first as a hobby on an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron"&gt;Acorn Electron&lt;/a&gt;). Here are some of my automation struggles:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still I don't completely grasp the concept of &lt;strong&gt;object-oriented programming&lt;/strong&gt;. Looking at all the code I've written over the years, a lot of it could have benefitted from an object oriented approach. Having that nagging feeling of &lt;em&gt;"this piece of code can be written much more effectively"&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More often than not I have to &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; for coding solutions. Almost feel a bit ashamed by that, feeling I'm wasting my valuable time. Functions I have used numerous times, I still looking it up on how the exact implementation is.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment I have a preference for Python as a programming- / scripting language, but am happy to code in any other language,.... part from &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript and C&lt;/strong&gt; (and all its variants). Don't know what it is with that, if I can I will avoid it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then there is my urge to &lt;strong&gt;refactor&lt;/strong&gt;. In itself a very essential and important part of coding, but must admit I sometimes take it to the extreme. Meaning I spend more time on it than I should, and leaving a piece of automation in an unusable state for too long. At least I hope the technical debt is kept to manageable levels.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The successes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily it is not all bad news. If it was, I would have given up on automation a long time ago. And it is successes like the following that gives me joy, and wants me to keep going with it:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I like about the team of people I work with today, is the &lt;strong&gt;collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; on our test automation suite. In my career I've set up numerous amounts of automation frameworks, often on my own. Now I'm part of a team where people's good ideas on automation has come together. This has resulted in a very robust framework, which forms an integral part of our delivery pipeline.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love it when I can use my coding skills to knock up something &lt;strong&gt;quick and dirty&lt;/strong&gt; to solve a problem. Be it using the API of a tool to extract or inject data, parsing a log file and plot performance metrics from it, write a wrapper around another piece of automation to make it more accessible. Not only is it handy for yourself, you can be of service to your colleagues.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm a &lt;strong&gt;curious&lt;/strong&gt; person. In relation to automation this means that I want to know about new tools, libraries, techniques, and how they potentially can be used in my work. Which has resulted in me setting up proof of concepts, that got later adopted by the team / project / company.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, &lt;strong&gt;refactoring&lt;/strong&gt; can be a struggle, but also is a mechanism to create success. It's great to see that as a result of refactoring, a codebase becomes better maintainable and easier accessible. That will always be a big win for me.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To reflect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the struggles, I will never give up on automation. The fun I have with it, and the successes I've achieved with it, far outweigh all the negative stuff around it. Working with automation gives me job satisfaction, but more importantly, with it I can add value. Despite I sometimes (have to) walk away from it, automation will always lure me back; &lt;em&gt;The automation is dead, long live the automation!&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Automation"></category><category term="Ministry Of Testing"></category></entry><entry><title>A commitment to yourself</title><link href="http://peetronics.com/ACommitmentToYourself.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-30T13:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-30T13:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Peet Michielsen</name></author><id>tag:peetronics.com,2021-01-30:/ACommitmentToYourself.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the topic of managing and achieving goals&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="drawing of arrows hitting a target" src="http://peetronics.com/images/goal.jpg" width="80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're going to talk about &lt;em&gt;managing and achieving goals&lt;/em&gt;, we can approach it from a lot of different angles.&lt;br&gt;
Several people from the tester's community already had a stab at it. &lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/bloggers-club-january-2021/46060"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just follow this link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and read some interesting and inspiring articles on this topic.  Here you will read about my spin on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objectives, Goals, and challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, goals are something completely different than objectives and challenges.  If you put them on a scale of formality, I would rank objectives as the most formal, challanges the least formal, and goals somewhere inbetween.&lt;br&gt;
Objectives are the things you set and evaluate on a regular basis, discuss with your manager, and used as input for your appraisals.  I see challenges mainly as a fun exercise which you do on your own or with others, with the aim to achieve something, e.g. a reward, certificate etc.  Of course objectives and challenges can be a personal thing, I see those where you do have an interaction with others.&lt;br&gt;
I tend to treat goals as a thing for myself, something &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; want to achieve, where I only have to hold myself accountable.  Truly &lt;strong&gt;a commitment to yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting and managing goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically you could treat anything you have- or want to do as a goal, but for the sake of this article lets not take it to that extreme.  I set goals for myself for various reasons:&lt;br&gt;
- when I want to learn something new&lt;br&gt;
- when I want- or need to have something done before a certain date&lt;br&gt;
- when I want to extend my comfort zone&lt;br&gt;
- when I want to achieve something  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an organised person, or at least that is what I want to believe. I have:
- a zero-inbox policy&lt;br&gt;
- clean (physical &amp;amp; computer) desktop policy&lt;br&gt;
- numerous digital lists, agenda items, reminders etc., following the &lt;a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/"&gt;Getting Things Done methodology by David Allen&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty obvious that the goals I set myself end up in one of these tools. And since I use these so frequently, almost implicitly my goals get a regular review.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Not) achieving goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, I do not achieve my goals.&lt;br&gt;
- not in the way I orginally set them out&lt;br&gt;
- not in the timeframe I put on it&lt;br&gt;
- not at all  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what, I'm not sad about it. As said earlier, I only need to hold myself accountable for it.  Even when a goal is not achieved, you will have gained a lot by working on it.&lt;br&gt;
- learned something &lt;br&gt;
- strenghtened a skill&lt;br&gt;
- relaxed your mind and body&lt;br&gt;
- got fitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something meta to conclude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had set myself a goal a while back to blog more often.  Put it on one of my lists, and blocked time in my calendar for it. Yet, I haven't written for a while. But see, here I am now, putting the last words of this post to paper. Well done Peet, goal achieved!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Ministry Of Testing"></category></entry><entry><title>Grab the opportunity</title><link href="http://peetronics.com/GrabTheOpportunity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-30T22:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-30T22:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Peet Michielsen</name></author><id>tag:peetronics.com,2020-10-30:/GrabTheOpportunity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What’s the best career advice you’ve ever had?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cartoon of someone walking the career path" src="http://peetronics.com/images/grab-the-opportunity.png" width="80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks I have been pondering over &lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/bloggers-club-september-october-2020-what-s-the-best-career-advice-you-ve-ever-had"&gt;this month's topic of the Ministry of Testing blogging club (&lt;em&gt;What’s the best career advice you’ve ever had?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, and wondering if I can write something meaningful about that.&lt;br&gt;
It was only after I went to bed one night and I couldn't immediately catch sleep, that it suddenly dawned on me the best advice I got was when I was still studying.&lt;br&gt;
One lecturer (can't remember who) of my studies in The Netherlands gave this little piece of wisdom: &lt;strong&gt;grab the opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Looking back at my career so far it has been the advice I have followed and lived by a lot; often more unknowingly than not...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said, the advice to &lt;em&gt;to grab the opportunity&lt;/em&gt; was given by a lecturer while I was &lt;a href="https://www.avans.nl/opleidingen/opleidingzoeker/business-it--management-breda-voltijd-bachelor/introductie#"&gt;studying at the HEAO in Breda&lt;/a&gt;.
But I can't remember who. There was another tutor however, called Ferrie Veen, and I always enjoyed his lectures. Probably because of his approach to teaching, which I really liked.&lt;br&gt;
One of the assignments he gave us was to compare yourself with an object and use that in a job application letter. I wrote a whole letter around a paperclip; the gist of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncomplicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versatile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more on that later...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the study was a student placement at a company for half a year, and work on a pre-defined practical assignment.
That went quite successful for me and as a result I was offered a job at that company after my graduation.
The first opportunity on my career path I grabbed. I landed a job without having to use my paperclip application letter, yet ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applying for my first job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before I started that job, the company went bust and I still had to go in search for a job. 
Looking back I could have seen it coming, but I was young and a bit naive (lesson learned).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck had it that, around the same time, a local bank where I lived was hiring for a role that matched my qualifications.
I immediately grabbed the opportunity to go to that bank and asked for the manager who was hiring, so I could introduce myself.
Of course I still had to write an official application, which I did. And yes, I did use the paperclip analogy.
I did get the job and I worked there for 2 1/2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving town&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my then partner graduated, she got a job at a tourist office, in a completely different part of the country. This meant We had to move and I had to look for a new job.
Got rejected a few times on jobs I applied for locally, which was of course dissapointing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of my kept telling about his work and that they were always looking for colleagues to join their team. But that was a 2 hour commute one way. 
I still applied though and was offered a job. And by coincidence at the same time I got offered a job closer to home.
After much deliberation I decided to take the offer further from home. Could have been interpreted as a stupid decision, but I never regretted it.
In the 6 1/2 years I worked there I had many opportunities to:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on great projects for different clients in a wide variety of industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share knowledge with colleagues as a trainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to know lots of people with whom some of them I am still in touch with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving abroad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our first child was born, something had to change in my work situation. I was away still a lot for work. And as a result of that, I only saw my son during the week when he was asleep.
Weighing the options, we decided to take the opportunity to settle ourselves abroad and start a Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast in Scotland. Something we often talked about.
As financial support it was wise to still have a steady income, so I went in search for a job. I had the luck that a software company in Aberdeen was hiring for a role that suited me perfectly.
I applied, had a telephone interview, flew out for a face to face interview, and soon after an offer was made. I willingly accepted, and so we packed our stuff and moved across the pond.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that company, I started as the first tester in a team of 12 developers. Over the years, I built up a structured testing discipline and culture. In the 12 years at that company I've grabbed many opportunities to grow mysself. 
By the time I left that company, a team of 15 test engineers was in place which I was in charge of.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my B&amp;amp;B adventures, I can tell many a story about that. But I will leave that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Redundancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not my plan to leave the company yet, as there still were so much more opportunities to be grabbed.
But beacause of a organisational restructure I was made redundant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew there weren't many job opportunities close by. So I had to look further afield for my next gig, and needed to be aware that it probably would take a bit longer to be back in fulltine work.
Then, a week into me &lt;em&gt;sitting&lt;/em&gt; at home, a friend pointed out that a local whisky distillery was looking for a tour guide. Well, that was an opportunity I couldn't let pass.
I showed my interest and soon I was showing tourists around &lt;a href="https://www.chivas.com/en-GB/visit-strathisla"&gt;Scotland's most beautiful distillery&lt;/a&gt;, while I still kept applying for jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily it didn't take too long to be made a new offer for a job. But it meant I was working away from home again ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been in my current job for almost 3 years now, and it already has given me lots of new opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to work on medical devices. Something I haven't done yet in my 20+ year career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to get my hands dirty again. Not being in a managerial role and doing actual testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to work with hard- and software. A whole new dimension and things to take into consideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to get into public speaking. A manager that encourages to submit papers for conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to get more involved with the testing community. A Ministry of Testing Meetup closer by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to make changes to the organisation. Bringing in 20+ years of experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to build a Community of Practice. Finding likeminded colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your career, there are many things coming on your path you can't foresee, and not always have influence on.
You can steer your career a lot yourself, but sometimes you need to look for opportunities, grab them, and help that get you further.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lets see what's the next opportunity ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Ministry Of Testing"></category><category term="Career"></category></entry><entry><title>I wish I knew more about ...</title><link href="http://peetronics.com/IWishIKnewMoreAbout.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-03T22:45:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-03T22:45:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Peet Michielsen</name></author><id>tag:peetronics.com,2020-09-03:/IWishIKnewMoreAbout.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the importance of knowing what you don't know and knowing how to gain knowledge&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="I wish I knew more about, against a library backdrop" src="http://peetronics.com/images/i_wish.png" width="80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The context&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish I knew more about ...&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I say regularly, both in a professional and private context. There are so many things I would like to know more about:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial intelligence / Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt;, and how to use that in my testing profession  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optomechanics&lt;/em&gt; (handy for my work) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electronics&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux &amp;amp; SSH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plumbing&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carpentry &amp;amp; joinery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rules of cricket&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;British history&lt;/em&gt; (particularly handy for pub quizzes ... )  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think I'm quite curious person by nature and, because of that,  I have a wide variety of interests. I always want to learn about knew things. That also means a know a little about a wide variety of things, but not a lot about a few specific topics.&lt;br&gt;
Having said that though, I've been involved in test automation for most of my professional career, so I dare to call myself a &lt;em&gt;specialist&lt;/em&gt; on that front. But then immediately add that there are plenty of others that know a lot more in that area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above, in the remainder of this post I want to touch on several aspects to come to my mind on the subject of &lt;em&gt;knowing more about&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to get to know more about something&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cartoon of data-information-knowledge-insight-wisdom" src="http://peetronics.com/images/knowledge.jpg" width="80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every day is a school day&lt;/em&gt;, you learn every day. Be it implicitly or explicitly. I don't want to go into details on implicit learning, part from saying that it is important to acknowledge that aspect (&lt;a href="http://peetronics.com/WhatIHaveLearnedToday-000.html"&gt;I've written about that in the past&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
As soon as you think or say "&lt;em&gt;I wish I knew more about ...&lt;/em&gt;", you state a desire you explicitly want to learn about a topic. And then it is up to you to find a way to gather that knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways to learn and gather knowledge:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: books, essays, blogs, articles, manuals, technical guides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching&lt;/strong&gt;: tutorials, demonstrations, conference talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schooling&lt;/strong&gt;: classes, courses, studies, certification, workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentoring&lt;/strong&gt;: coaching, training, consulting, counseling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practicing&lt;/strong&gt;: challenges, exercises, dojos, hackathons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many different options, it is important that you find the best approach for type of knowledge gathering you want to do. Some are better suited for certain purposes than others.  Wanting to know more about philosophy probably requires a more extensive study than learning how to make kimchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also find a way of learning what your comfortable with. For me personally, reading is not the easiest way. I rather learn by watching and having hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Acknowledgement of your limited knowledge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much you know about a certain topic, there probably - no, certainly - will be people out there that know as much or even more on that same topic. Several things to be said on this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stimulates collaboration. Know what you know, know what you don't know, know what others know, know what others don't know. Complement each other's knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows your to keep learning. be it directly from the others you work with, be it from the vast majority of resources that are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shows modesty. Which is not a bad thing ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, don't get complacent, be open to more learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Being fine with not knowing everything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, it can be frustrating not knowing enough about a certain topic. It can make you feel insecure (&lt;em&gt;am I good enough for this job?&lt;/em&gt;), you might see yourself as an imposter, you feel unconfident amongst colleagues and peers, and, it is just annoying not knowing the answer to the winning question in a pub quiz....  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind however, that you &lt;strong&gt;can't&lt;/strong&gt; know everything and you don't &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to know everything. Be selective on the things you want to know more about. Pick out the things that can bring you further (in any way), delve into subjects that bring you joy. And for the rest, of the things you don't know, there are people &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; the knowledge you can ask and collaborate with...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Impetus for this article&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't written a blog post in a while, &lt;a href="http://peetronics.com/WhatIHaveLearnedToday-retrospective.html"&gt;though I made myself a promise to write more&lt;/a&gt;. But hey, that's how things go (don't beat yourself up on that Peet!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there have been a few triggers that made me decide to write this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/bloggers-club"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Testing&lt;/strong&gt; has reignited their &lt;strong&gt;bloggers club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I have let a few iterations slip, but ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... &lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/bloggers-club-august-september-2020-i-wish-i-knew-more-about"&gt;This month's topic&lt;/a&gt; is close to my heart and think I can write a meaningful article about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two weeks ago, I joined in on an &lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/ama-how-to-start-blogging-ama-with-louise-gibbs-bruce-chris-armstrong-lee-marshall"&gt;Ask Me Anything session on blogging&lt;/a&gt;, facilitated by the Ministry of Testing, hosted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BruceOnlyBruce"&gt;@BruceOnlyBruce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/christovskia"&gt;@christovskia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Louise_J_Gibbs"&gt;@Louise_J_Gibbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ThePirateTester"&gt;@ThePirateTester&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of wisdom and tips in there and enough reasons on why you should write more.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with all of that, I hadn't any excuse anymore NOT to write a blog post. What you've been reading is the result. Hope you found it useful. Feel free to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeetRonics"&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt; if you want to comment or discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="Ministry Of Testing"></category><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Testing"></category></entry><entry><title>What I Have Learned Today - #009</title><link href="http://peetronics.com/WhatIHaveLearnedToday-009.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-13T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-13T21:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Peet Michielsen</name></author><id>tag:peetronics.com,2019-11-13:/WhatIHaveLearnedToday-009.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reviewing abstracts for talks — learn from others&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="review testbash abstracts" src="http://peetronics.com/images/review-testbash-abstracts.png" width="80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reviewing abstracts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I have tweeted about the benefits of reviewing abstracts for talks. In this case the ones for upcoming &lt;em&gt;TestBashes&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Ministry of Testing&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peetronics/status/1108145209269993474"&gt;Tweet of peetronics/1108145209269993474&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides valuable feedback for the applicants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an easy way to give back to the (testing) community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you a sneak peek into what is current in the field of testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you ideas for submitting your own abstracts (if you’ve got the ambition into public speaking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all lots of opportunities to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt;. I encourage everyone to get involved in this. Follow &lt;a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/testbash/review"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reviewing and writing feedback&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to do this activity on a regular basis; once or twice a month, like tonight. I had some time set aside to go through a batch of abstracts. Finished quicker than I thought as after 6 or so proposals there were no more left for me to review 😅.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="message: There are no proposals to review at this time" src="http://peetronics.com/images/no-reviews.png" width="80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, I want to focus on what I &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; from these kind of exercises. As well as the benefits laid out in the aforementioned bullet-points, doing an activity like this will sharpen your skills like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critically reading&lt;/strong&gt; a piece of text. Sometimes you grasp an abstract in a first read, but often it needs to be read two or more times to get an understanding of the applicant’s intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a judgement&lt;/strong&gt; based on what you’ve read. Once the proposal is understood, an assessment needs to be made, using predefined criteria (like: context, relevance, originality etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating constructive feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. And when the assessment is made, this needs to be relayed back to the organisation and author. And especially this is an area where I continue to learn. It’s harder than you think to write something that can be used by the recipient as input to improve upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy learning!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2018 a question was asked on the Ministry of Testing website on &lt;a href="https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/99-things-you-can-do-to-become-a-better-software-tester/17923"&gt;99 Things You Can Do To Become A Better Software Tester&lt;/a&gt;. I contributed to that as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image of thread response; transcript below this image" src="http://peetronics.com/images/never-stop-learning-club.PNG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;come&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;across&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;didn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;know&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;All&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;these&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;little&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;learnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;better&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Definitely give that link above a read. There is a lot to be learned from that thread :-).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;More on learning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning doesn’t have to be explicit and by doing the mental exercise of asking myself &lt;em&gt;what I have learned today&lt;/em&gt; I “force” myself to also recognise the implicit learning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="quote: “Once you stop learning, you start dying” -Albert Einstein-" src="http://peetronics.com/images/lifelong-learning1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far I’m not an expert in this field and I speak solely from my own experience. However, I do read the occasional thing, and this &lt;a href="https://blueprintleadership.com/just-keep-learning-just-keep-learning/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; links very well with what I’m talking about here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as reading, I’m an avid podcast and audiobook listener. In the latest episode of &lt;a href="http://theguiltytester.libsyn.com/the-guilty-tester-episode-12-testbash-manchester-unexpo-2019-part-1"&gt;The Guilty Tester Podcast&lt;/a&gt; (at time of writing), Dave Duke (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theguiltytester"&gt;@theguiltytester&lt;/a&gt;) talks about his recent attendance of TestBash Manchester 2019. He had a stand at the UnExpo where he collected things what people felt guilty about in testing. It touched on learning and here is some of the advice from this podcast, but make sure to subscribe and listen to the whole episode as well:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Don&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;guilty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;about&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Just&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;learn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;turn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wrong&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;far&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;better&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;than&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;learning&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;The challenge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the same conference as Dave Duke. One of the presenters was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisihocke"&gt;@lisihocke&lt;/a&gt;. She sets herself a personal challenge every year and at the conference she talked about her challenge to become more &lt;em&gt;code confident&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisihocke/status/1179783401139818498"&gt;Tweet of lisihocke/1179783401139818498&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Lisi and her great talk I wanted to set my own challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said, asking myself the question (as per the title) has been mainly a mental exercise, and so far that has been perfectly fine. But now I want to get it out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a challenge I will start to share the outcome of my daily mental exercise of asking what I have learned today with the whole wide world. Starting tomorrow (05–11–2019), I will post on Twitter a link to this Medium blog with what I have learned. Initially I will do this daily for a month and then take stock. I will see if I stick with the format, keep up with the frequency… or maybe stop altogether :-(.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items to be expect can be of all sorts. Work related, testing, personal, hobby, culinary, politics, and who knows what. So as you can see, much more than testing alone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I will use Medium as a blogging platform. I’ve got plans for something different, but that will be a whole different challenge. More on that in the future (thanks Lisi!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for the hashtag #WhatIHaveLearnedToday  &lt;/p&gt;
